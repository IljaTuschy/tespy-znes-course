    "# A quick start into TESPy\n",
    "\n",
    "## General information\n",
    "\n",
    "[TESPy](https://tespy.readthedocs.io) is an open-source framework for the simulation of component based thermodynamic\n",
    "conversion processes. With the software you can use predefined components such as a pump, compressor, heat exchanger,\n",
    "turbine or valve (and many more) to build thermodynamic systems. The system is set up by connecting the components in a\n",
    "generic way and then specifying respective process and component parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software then performs a steady state simulation of your system by creating and solving a system of equations in the \n",
    "so-called *equation oriented (EO)* approach, i.e. components are not calculated stepwise, but simultaniously in a generic\n",
    "way. The system represents the individual topology and component and process specifications provided by you. TESPy \n",
    "accomplishes this by solving for\n",
    "\n",
    "- mass flow,\n",
    "- pressure and\n",
    "- enthalpy\n",
    "- (as well as fluid composition)\n",
    "\n",
    "of every connection between two components. After solving a model, missing component and process\n",
    "parameters - for example: efficiencies, temperatures, pressure losses - are determined based on this information. The\n",
    "EO approach lets the modeler choose, which parameters are inputs and which parameters are results: For instance, a\n",
    "compressor efficiency can be an input and the system variables are solved to meet that constraint, or it can be a result\n",
    "of other inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mini example\n",
    "\n",
    "TESPy consists of three main building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- class `Network` as container of the simulation\n",
    "- class `Component` (children of them: `Compressor`, `Valve`, ...), in which\n",
    "  thermodynamic conversion processes take place\n",
    "- class `Connection`, which define the topology of the `Network`\n",
    "  by connecting the individual components\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will create two simple networks to show the principle of TESPy. For further tutorials and examples\n",
    "we recommend looking into the online documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling a Compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are modeling a compressor, which compresses fully saturated steam of a refrigerant to a higher pressure level. The\n",
    "figure below shows the abstract representation of the component. The respective table summarizes the\n",
    "process parameters we are going to apply in our example.\n",

    "In a fist step the topology has to be set up. For this a network has to be defined. In our python code, we import the `Network` class from `tespy.networks`. After this we define our network in just calling this function. In general the initialization of `Network()` needs no arguments but it has optional arguments. In our example we use this option to set the units of pressure und temperature to $\\mathrm{bar}$ and $\\mathrm{°C}$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the components of the network have to be defined. These include the compressor of course. But as every connnecion is connecting two components, we alsop need a source of the working fluid in our simple example and a sink. Consequently we import the classes `Source`, `Compressor`and `Sink` from `tespy.components`. Initializing the components it is mandatory to include a label for the component. This is done just after initializing the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, the components have to be connected. This is done by using the `Connection`class that is imported from `tespy.connections`. When initializing a connection it has to be defined where it starts and where it ends. In our example we connect the first connection to the outlet of the source and the inlet of the compressor. Connections additionally need some kind of identifier which again is the label of the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in defining the topology is adding the connections to the network using the `add_conns` method of the network instance."
