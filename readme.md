# ZNES TESPy Master Course

TESPy is a python simulation toolkit for thermal engineering that has been developed at Flensburg University of Applied Sciences' Center of Sustainable Energy Systems (in German: ZNES). TESPy is part of the open energy modelling framework oemof and consequently an open source project.

The ZNES TESPy Master Course is a step by step course set up in week by week computer lab sessions. It is targeting master students in the field of energy technology who want to get started using python and TESPy for typical tasks in thermal engineering. This could be simulating the operation of single components, analizing or even optimizing cycles built of these components. The course is designed for learning and working in groups. The teaching concept is to provide know-why insights via own expenience in facing challenges in the field of computational thermal engineering. The course includes some theoretical background that shall help to understand the concepts applied. In this the course provides a kind of complementary approach to the extensive TESPY documentation that also includes many examples but is rather designed for students or professionals already experienced in thermal engineering. 

The ZNES TESPy course still assumes that students have basic knowledge on both python and thermodynamics. However, those who don't have that will surely find a lot of freely available content elsewhere making it possible to catch up before and while taking the course. Starting with that the course teaches how to make use of python and TESPy for 

- basic thermodynamic calculations, 
- balancing of thermal engineering components like compressors or heat exchangers
- simulation of cycles such as heat pumps or ORC power plants in both design and off-design mode
- professional engineering methods for visualizing results and optimizing setups

Course material and content is open to anyone but students will most likely make the best of it working with the concepts in guided computer lab sessions. With this in mind teachers are invited to adapt the course to their own needs and preferences for other universities.
