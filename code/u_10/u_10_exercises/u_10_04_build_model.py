# Flowsheet + data table
# Calculate specific outcome (e.g. COP, eta_th, ...)
# possible examples
# - pressurized air system with intermediate cooling
# - heat exchanger with both sides, one side with a pump for flow through, one
#   side with pump to pressurize system
# - flash process using pump, heater to saturated water, valve throttle to original pressure
#   calculate steam and liquid mass flow at valve exit
